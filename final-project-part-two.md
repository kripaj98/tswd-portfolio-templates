## Title Page: Does Architecture Evoke Emotion? Emotion Mapping of Memorial Spaces</br>

## Setting the Background: 
Memorial spaces are significant in shaping the emotional and cultural experiences of their visitors. These sites often engage a diverse range of emotions, deeply rooted in their historical and social context.</br>

### Justification for Study:</br>

High visitor engagement is correlateed with strong emotional and cultural impact.
Data Example: The National Park Service (2020) lists 31 national memorials and 5 affiliated sites across the U.S.
Data Example: There are over 35,000 museums in the U.S. (IMLS).
Case Study: The 9/11 Memorial attracts 2.2 million visitors annually (Daily Passport, 2023).</br>

This study will use emotion mapping to navigate the experience of memorial spaces, linking architectural elements to emotional responses. Thus defining a legend data viz based on Plutchik's emotional wheel.</br>

## Defining Memorial Architecture and its Impact: 
Memorial architecture is designed to honor significant events, individuals, or tragedies. These spaces evoke deep emotional responses, often shaped by the design's materiality, scale, and purpose. The emotional impact varies depending on the memorial’s intention, whether it's to commemorate a specific historical event or provide a place of healing.</br>

I have decided to focus on five to ten prominent memorials, selected based on visitor footfall and cultural significance, and analyze how architectural elements contribute to emotional experiences. The memorials will be plotted on a world map, with each memorial linked to the top five emotions felt(as bar chart) by visitors, derived from user reviews on TripAdvisor. Each case study will be introduced by highlighting the memorial's purpose, design, and visitor numbers.</br>

## Case Studies & Emotional Impact: Three memorials will be explored:</br>

The Jewish Memorial in Berlin</br>
The 9/11 Memorial in New York</br>
The Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C. (subject to change).</br>
For each, emotions will be mapped onto their respective floor plan to specific architectural elements such as material, scale, and spatial design. User-generated testimonials will be analyzed to create a word map, further emphasizing the emotional connection to the space, while also a brief introduction to each.</br>

## Defining Insights: 
In the final section, emotion responses is collected across 10 memorials, identifying key emotional triggers related to specific architectural features. This data-driven approach provides a deeper understanding of how design elements shape emotional experiences, guiding future memorial designs to evoke the desired emotional responses.</br>

Architectural Elements & Emotional Responses: Through heat map analysis, we will explore how materiality, scale, and transparency contribute to emotional responses. Key insights include:</br>

> Cold Stone: evokes somber, reflective emotions.
> Warm Wood: creates a sense of comfort and solace.
> Transparency: symbolizes hope and openness.</br>
A comparative analysis will cross-reference visitor emotions with the architectural elements to reveal deeper insights into how design influences human experiences in memorial spaces.</br>

## Call to Action (CTA): 
This exploration of memorial spaces offers valuable insights into how architecture can evoke profound emotional responses. As we continue to analyze the intersection of space, materiality, and emotion, we invite you to contribute to the conversation, whether through sharing your experiences with memorials, offering additional case studies, or engaging with the findings to inform the future of memorial design.

# User research 

## Target audience
I hope to reach architects, designers, and memorial curators, as well as anyone interested in how space and design influence emotions, sparking deeper conversations about the impact of architecture on collective memory.</br>
To identify representative individuals driving my story, I focused on gathering feedback through trip advisor from a diverse range of memorial visitors, including those from different cultural backgrounds and emotional responses, ensuring a holistic understanding; while also referring to scholarly materials, and inputs from some architecture friends.
