# "Is Architecture Responsible for Evoking Emotions: Through Emotion Mapping of Memorial Spaces"

# Outline : The Idea

Using a data driven, visual narrative to tell tale of how specific architectural elements, such as material, scale, and spatial attributes, provoke emotional responses in visitors while navigating through spaces; limiting the scope to memorial architecture.

# The Narrative

Imagine walking into a memorial. The moment you step inside, something shifts—perhaps a sense of solemnity washes over you, or an unexpected feeling of tranquility takes hold. But why? What is it about these spaces that stir such deep, immediate but shifting emotions?

Memorial spaces are more than just stone and steel; they are silent storytellers, carefully designed to evoke memories, grief, resilience, hope and so on... Every mood, material, scale, and spatial element is a deliberate choice, shaping the way visitors experience and interact with the space.

This project unravels the hidden language of single type of public architecture, the memorial architecture through data visualization, showing how design choices, whether the sheer black granite of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, the towering concrete blocks of Berlin’s Holocaust Memorial, or the infinite pools of the 9/11 Memorial—provoke powerful emotional responses.

In the end, this project is about more than architecture. It’s about how we remember, how we feel, and how spaces can shape our emotion in ways we don’t always recognize, but always experience.

# Call to Action & Stakeholders Involved

Next time you visit a memorial, pause and take in the space...not just its form, but the emotions it stirs. Notice how the materials, colors, and elements guide your thoughts and feelings. Ask yourself why is this the way it is, why is there a huge slanting wall here? Being said that this study would be valuable in the following manner:
1. Architects & Urban Designers: To create more emotionally resonant and impactful spaces.
2. Historians & Cultural Institutions: To understand how memorial design shapes collective memory.
3. Psychologists & Researchers: To analyze the relationship between space and human emotion.
4. Public & Policy Makers: To foster meaningful public spaces that engage visitors emotionally.
5. Visitor - Retrospecting their behaviour and reaction patterns while moving through spaces, while understanding spatial attributes as driving forces of their positive or negative mood.

_Actionable Takeaways: By uncovering the psychological impact of memorial design through quantitative and qualitative data gathered through research papers, this project provides a framework or rather a trigger for designing elements within future spaces that evoke the intended emotions, whether it be grief, reflection, or hope. Having awareness of these architectural principles being more than functionality, and being critical about the connection of spaces with human emotions._


# Response to the Narrative : 

The project will seek to illustrate the complex, layered emotions people experience while navigating the diverse elements constituting the memorial sites, to foster empathy and understanding across different stakeholders experiencing the story

The presentation will incorporate visual elements, such as photographs of memorials, along with testimonies found on public forums to help viewers connect emotionally with the subject matter.

# Project Structure:

<img src="Emotional arc.jpg" width="1000"/>

The main idea would be to leverage visualisation and data to take one experiencing this narrative, through a series of shifting emotional arc along the journey of navigating this argument.

## Introduction to Memorial & Emotions:
Definition of memorials: 
Cultural significance, historical context, and the role of memorials in different societies while also defining the reason for selection, maybe also involve the spread of memorial by plotting on a map, across US or the world to emphasise its importance

Overview of emotions: 
Understanding attributes of emotions and classifying them based on usage within the study

## Case-studies:
A brief overview of 2/3 popular memorials, as a horizontal scroll bar by highlighting various spaces and elements, the story it meant to convey overlapped with visitor responses, to further help understand the idea of design and the strategies.

## Emotional journey of Memorial:
Exploration of the emotions people experience when visiting memorials: grief, catharsis, solidarity, more as an emotional map overlapped while moving across different spaces (over a movement diagram).

Categorising them into 3 categories of architecture; color, scale and proportion, elements and materiality and drawing connections with the emotions evoked. For eg.:

   1. Space and Scale: 
   _How the size of a memorial can evoke feelings of awe, humility, or isolation. Like the large scale of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial creates a sense of reverence and solemnity._
   
   2. Materiality: 
   _The emotional impact of materials like stone, metal, and glass. The use of polished black granite in the Vietnam Memorial reflects the names of the fallen, inviting personal reflection._
   
   3. Light and Shadow:
   _How natural and artificial light are used to create a mood or emphasize certain features. The way light filters through the canopy of trees at the 9/11 Memorial creates an atmosphere of peace amidst sorrow._
   
   4. Symbolism:
   _The use of symbolic shapes and forms, such as circles, walls, or voids, to represent ideas like eternity, loss, or the absence of life. Example: The sunken design of the 9/11 Memorial’s reflecting pools symbolizes the void left by the tragedy, and the absence of life lost._

User stories and personal connections:
Personal narratives from individuals who have experienced profound emotional connections to memorial sites.

## Conclusion : 
A conclusive series of a chart highlighting specific architectural elements intentionally designed to evoke particular emotions, more of as a basic guideline for designing for a memorial.

# The data
I plan on leveraging publicly available data sources that provide information on various memorial sites, architectural features, and their emotional impact on visitors while using quantitative and qualitative elements to create a dataset to further help me with the project. The primary data sources focuses on gathering data on the design elements of iconic memorials (e.g., material types, scale, proportions, light usage, and color) from architectural databases and publications. This may include data from sources like the American Institute of Architects (AIA), ArchDaily, and memorial archives that publish detailed case studies and technical specifications of well-known memorials, such as the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, 9/11 Memorial, and Holocaust Memorial as well as scholary materials.Below I have tried to break down how some specific sources could or might contribute:

### 1. Architecture Design & Memorial Features:

To understand the physical and symbolic characteristics of memorials, I will use detailed architectural analyses and design documentation from the following sources:

Data Example: Descriptions of spatial arrangements and symbolic material use (e.g., reflective surfaces symbolizing introspection).
   _[Memorial Architecture: Emotional Design and Social Memory Intertwined](https://www.forwardpathway.us/memorial-architecture-emotional-design-and-social-memory-intertwined)_

Data Example: Case studies on visitor flow patterns in memorials and their link to emotional immersion.
   _[Memorials as Spaces of Engagement: Design, Use, and Meaning] (https://www.academia.edu/14836368/Memorials_as_Spaces_of_Engagement_Design_Use_and_Meaning)_

Data Example: Specific measurements of material finishes and lighting techniques for iconic memorials like the Holocaust Memorial.
   _[ The Emotional Expression of Memorial Architecture Design](https://www.scientific.net/AMM.174-177.1739)_

### 2. Visitor Experience and Emotional Responses:

Understanding visitor emotions is crucial to bridging the gap between design and its psychological effects. The following sources will be used:

Data Example: Emotional responses associated with cool colors (e.g., blue for calmness) and warm tones (e.g., red for grief or anger).
   _([Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18XykR_IyoEh9t8LJveS367n34xiVEtGU?usp=drive_link))_

Data Example: Survey-based data correlating emotional intensity (e.g., awe, sadness) with architectural dimensions (e.g., heights, enclosed spaces).
   _[The Cognitive-Emotional Design and Study of Architectural Space](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8004070/#notes5)_

Data Example: Emotional response datasets linked to angular vs. curved designs in memorials.
   _[ The Emotional Influence of Different Geometries in Virtual Spaces](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272494422000470)_

### 3. Integrating Design and Emotional Analysis:

To bridge the architectural features with visitor emotions, I will rely on qualitative analysis and synthesis of patterns:

Data Example: Visitor feedback on textures (e.g., rough stone vs. smooth reflective surfaces) and their emotional impact.
   _[Memorials as Spaces of Engagement: Design, Use and Meaning](https://www.academia.edu/14836368/Memorials_as_Spaces_of_Engagement_Design_Use_and_Meaning)_

Data Example: Pairing of color tones (e.g., black granite vs. translucent glass) with emotional descriptors like “serenity,” “grief,” or “introspection.”
   _[Memorials as Healing Places: A Matrix for Bridging Material Design and Visitor Experience](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/11/6711) | [Emotionally-oriented design in museums: a case study of the Jewish Museum Berlin](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1423466/full)_

I have created a sample data set which could help visualise how specific design elements contribute to the emotional impact of memorials. _[Sample dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xGp8JLpCRNKH2Rkh_LOQaMlvzpF_NnmV/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=113244834183528493745&rtpof=true&sd=true)_

Possibilities could involve:

1. Columns like "Material Type" and "Color Scheme" can be analyzed to identify common patterns across different memorials (e.g., granite and neutral tones for solemnity) or data on "Memorial Scale" or "Proportions" can be linked to emotional intensity—larger scales may evoke awe, while smaller, intimate spaces may inspire reflection.
2. Cross-analyze visitor feedback with architectural features. For instance, see if reflective materials like polished stone or water features correlate with feelings of introspection or healing.

The Excel sheet will serve as a foundational dataset to back up my analysis of design elements and emotional impacts. It can help create specific, data-driven visualizations that enhance the storytelling aspect of my project, such as comparative analyses, emotional heatmap, and interactive visitor sentiment breakdowns. 

_I am still in the process of collecting more data_

# Method and medium

For completing my final project, I plan on using Shorthand for creating an interactive storytelling experience combined with Tableau for data visualization. Shorthand will help me craft an engaging, multimedia narrative starting with the introduction, focusing on the emotional journey through memorials, while Tableau will be used to display the analyzed data, showing how different architectural elements in memorials correlate with emotional responses. I might also use gis, to map memorial spots across US. By integrating these tools, I will create an interactive experience that allows viewers to explore both the design elements of memorials and the emotional impact they evoke. This method would align with an interactive project with pop ups of user stories and elements to navigate an emotional journey while provides a user-friendly way to understand complex emotional and architectural relationships.

Focus points:
A scroll down journey with interactive visualizations and real-world data, we will map these architectural elements to human emotions, bringing to life the psychological impact of memorial spaces in a way that helps to engage.

_1. Interactive data visualizations that show the emotional responses to architectural elements across different memorials._

_2. Story-driven content that guides the user through the architectural analysis, explaining how materials, scale, and color influence emotions._

_3. The data visualizations in Tableau will display correlations, such as:_

    > The size of a memorial and its correlation to visitor feelings of awe.
    > The emotional impact of reflective surfaces and the colors used in memorial designs.
    > Comparison of memorials by emotional responses.
    
_4. Lastly picking some case studies to develop an interactive emotion mapping route using mix media of architecture plans of spaces, sketched over emotion analysis through customer experience overlapped as a stop motion video._

In the end, this project is about more than architecture. It’s about how we remember, how we feel, and how spaces can shape human emotion in ways we don’t always recognize but always experience.
