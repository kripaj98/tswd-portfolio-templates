# "Is Architecture Responsible for Evoking Emotions: Through Emotion Mapping of Memorial Spaces"

# Outline : The Idea

Using a data driven, visual narrative to tell tale of how specific architectural elements, such as material, scale, and spatial attributes, provoke emotional responses in visitors while navigating through spaces; limiting the scope to memorial architecture.

# The Narrative

Imagine walking into a memorial. The moment you step inside, something shifts—perhaps a sense of solemnity washes over you, or an unexpected feeling of tranquility takes hold. But why? What is it about these spaces that stir such deep, immediate but shifting emotions?

Memorial spaces are more than just stone and steel; they are silent storytellers, carefully designed to evoke memories, grief, resilience, hope and so on... Every mood, material, scale, and spatial element is a deliberate choice, shaping the way visitors experience and interact with the space.

This project unravels the hidden language of single type of public architecture, the memorial architecture through data visualization, showing how design choices, whether the sheer black granite of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, the towering concrete blocks of Berlin’s Holocaust Memorial, or the infinite pools of the 9/11 Memorial—provoke powerful emotional responses.

In the end, this project is about more than architecture. It’s about how we remember, how we feel, and how spaces can shape our emotion in ways we don’t always recognize, but always experience.

# Call to Action & Stakeholders Involved

Next time you visit a memorial, pause and take in the space...not just its form, but the emotions it stirs. Notice how the materials, colors, and elements guide your thoughts and feelings. Ask yourself why is this the way it is, why is there a huge slanting wall here? Being said that this study would be valuable in the following manner:
1. Architects & Urban Designers: To create more emotionally resonant and impactful spaces.
2. Historians & Cultural Institutions: To understand how memorial design shapes collective memory.
3. Psychologists & Researchers: To analyze the relationship between space and human emotion.
4. Public & Policy Makers: To foster meaningful public spaces that engage visitors emotionally.
5. Visitor - Retrospecting their behaviour and reaction patterns while moving through spaces, while understanding spatial attributes as driving forces of their positive or negative mood.

_Actionable Takeaways: By uncovering the psychological impact of memorial design through quantitative and qualitative data gathered through research papers, this project provides a framework or rather a trigger for designing elements within future spaces that evoke the intended emotions, whether it be grief, reflection, or hope. Having awareness of these architectural principles being more than functionality, and being critical about the connection of spaces with human emotions._


# Response to the Narrative : 

The project will seek to illustrate the complex, layered emotions people experience while navigating the diverse elements constituting the memorial sites, to foster empathy and understanding across different stakeholders experiencing the story

The presentation will incorporate visual elements, such as photographs of memorials, along with testimonies found on public forums to help viewers connect emotionally with the subject matter.

# Project Structure:

The main idea would be to leverage visualisation and data to take one experiencing this narrative, through a series of shifting emotional arc along the journey of navigating this argument.

## Introduction to Memorial & Emotions:
Definition of memorials: 
Cultural significance, historical context, and the role of memorials in different societies while also defining the reason for selection, maybe also involve the spread of memorial by plotting on a map, across US or the world to emphasise its importance

Overview of emotions: 
Understanding attributes of emotions and classifying them based on usage within the study

## Case-studies:
A brief overview of 2/3 popular memorials, as a horizontal scroll bar by highlighting various spaces and elements, the story it meant to convey overlapped with visitor responses, to further help understand the idea of design and the strategies.

## Emotional journey of Memorial:
Exploration of the emotions people experience when visiting memorials: grief, catharsis, solidarity, more as an emotional map overlapped while moving across different spaces (over a movement diagram).

Categorising them into 3 categories of architecture; color, scale and proportion, elements and materiality and drawing connections with the emotions evoked. For eg.:

   ### 1. Space and Scale: 
   _How the size of a memorial can evoke feelings of awe, humility, or isolation. Like the large scale of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial creates a sense of reverence and solemnity._
   
   ### 2. Materiality: 
   _The emotional impact of materials like stone, metal, and glass. The use of polished black granite in the Vietnam Memorial reflects the names of the fallen, inviting personal reflection._
   
   ### 3. Light and Shadow:
   _How natural and artificial light are used to create a mood or emphasize certain features. The way light filters through the canopy of trees at the 9/11 Memorial creates an atmosphere of peace amidst sorrow._
   
   ### 4. Symbolism:
   _The use of symbolic shapes and forms, such as circles, walls, or voids, to represent ideas like eternity, loss, or the absence of life. Example: The sunken design of the 9/11 Memorial’s reflecting pools symbolizes the void left by the tragedy, and the absence of life lost._

## User stories and personal connections:
Personal narratives from individuals who have experienced profound emotional connections to memorial sites.

## Conclusion : 
A conclusive series of a chart highlighting specific architectural elements intentionally designed to evoke particular emotions, more of as a basic guideline for designing for a memorial.
