# About me
_Hello! This is Kripa and I am pursuing Master of Entertainment Industry Management at CMU. Storytelling has always been at the heart of my journey, whether designing spaces as an architect, crafting immersive worlds as a set designer, or shaping narratives through brand strategy. These experiences sparked my fascination with the power of visuals to convey meaning and connect with audiences._

_This portfolio explores the art of data visualization: how design transforms information into compelling stories. Iâ€™m interested in the interplay of readability, narrative, and emotional impact, seeking to develop a framework for critiquing and refining visual storytelling._

# What I hope to learn
All the things - obviously. 
1. Refine skills to create impactful narratives through data visualization, enhancing brand strategies.
2. Understand how users interact with visuals to craft intuitive, engaging designs that resonate with audiences.
3. Building a structured method to analyze and critique data visualizations to help me with designing strategic solutions

# Portfolio
I am still working on designing a structure for this part and it would be further enhanced as we progress through the course. Here is a basic list:

## Assignment 1: [Controlling Color](controlling-color)
In progress...

## Assignment 3&4: [Critique by Design](critique-by-design)
