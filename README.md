# About me
_Hello! This is Kripa and I am pursuing Master of Entertainment Industry Management at CMU. Storytelling has always been at the heart of my journey, whether designing spaces as an architect, crafting immersive worlds as a set designer, or shaping narratives through brand strategy. These experiences sparked my fascination with the power of visuals to convey meaning and connect with audiences._

_This portfolio explores the art of data visualization: how design transforms information into compelling stories. Iâ€™m interested in the interplay of readability, narrative, and emotional impact, seeking to develop a framework for critiquing and refining visual storytelling._

# What I hope to learn
All the things - obviously. 
1. Refine skills to create impactful narratives through data visualization, enhancing brand strategies.
2. Understand how users interact with visuals to craft intuitive, engaging designs that resonate with audiences.
3. Building a structured method to analyze and critique data visualizations to help me with designing strategic solutions

# Portfolio
Here is the list of my work:

## Assignment: [Visualizing overnment Debt](visualizing-government-debt)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `visualizing-government-debt.md`.  For links to Markdown files in your repository, you can just include the name of the page without the `.md` extension. 

## Assignment 3&4: [Critique by Design](critique-by-design)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `critique-by-design.md`.  

## Final project
Here it might be helpful to include a high-level description of your final project. 
[Part I](final-project-part-one)
[Part II](final-project-part-two)
[Part III](final-project-part-three)

### Setting up a separate page

So here's the code you'll need to add to your own site to create a second page. 

1. First, create a new page in your repository (for example, dataviz1.md)
2. Next, add a link to that page by inserting the following into your readme.md page:

`[title](dataviz)` or `[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` or `[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)`

Any of those formats will work. Here's some examples of working links: 

`[title](dataviz)` = [title](dataviz)  
`[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` = [dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)  
`[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)` = [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)   

Make sure to check these from your publicly accessible URL to make sure they're working correctly (not from the preview tab).
