# Critique and Redesign

_For each step below, you should document your progress as you move forward.  In terms of tone, think of the writeup as though you're keeping journal of your step-by-step process.   You should include a any insights you gained from the critique method, and what it led you to think about when considering the redesign.  You should talk about how you moved next to the sketches, and any insights you gleaned from your user feedback.  Document what you changed based on the user feedback in your redesign.  Finally, talk about what your redesigned data visualization shows, why you selected the data visualization you did, and what you attempted to show or do differently._

_You can include screenshots, sketches or other artifacts with your narrative to help tell the story of how you moved through the process.  Again, make sure to avoid including any personally identifying information about your interviewees (don't list full names, etc.).  While this template serves as a guide, make sure to reference the assignment writeup on Canvas for the official guidance.  This template does not include all guidance mentioned on the assignment page._

## Step one: The Visualization

_[link to the original data visualization](https://data.world/makeovermonday/generative-ai-search-trends-in-the-united-states)_  

While selecting this particular data viz on Gen AI search trends in US based on region, I was initially drawn to the subject matter itself. AI-generated imagery, especially the 3 tools analysed here is something I’ve been exploring personally, and understanding regional interest of these tools based on google trends (DALL·E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion) felt intriguing. Looking at the viz sparks a lot of questions about technology adoption variation across location; about what factors drive these differences? Are they cultural, economic, or perhaps tied to industry hubs? An interest topic for the 3 companies themselves, to understand a surface level positioning within regions and overall understanding of the competitor.

At first glance, the original visualization was somewhat unclear. The numbers were there, but they didn’t immediately tell a story. I had to take a step back and ask: What exactly am I looking at? Were these just random search volumes or normalized trends for each region? Why were some states leading in searches for one tool over another? The data hinted at regional preferences, but without additional context, such as population density, or digital adoption rates, but it definitely was a start, however it was difficult to determine why certain states ranked higher and would there be confounding to correlate to adoption of the tool.

I also saw potential in the dataset’s depth. There wasn’t just one story here, but multiple narratives waiting to be uncovered. This made it a great exercise in narrowing down focus, a skill I want to refine, especially when dealing with large datasets. Additionally, the original visualization was interactive, which posed an interesting challeng of how do you translate an interactive viz into a static one without losing clarity or information so it is easier to understand at a glance? What works better in which contexts? This project became an opportunity to experiment with storytelling through visualization, refining both my analytical and design instincts in the process.

## Step two: the critique
_Don't forget to complete the Google Form found on the assignment page.  You can summarize your thoughts here._

## Step three: Sketch a solution

## Step four: Test the solution

_Before you conduct your interviews, prepare a simple script.  Use this as a guide and as a way to take notes as you go forward. Come up with your own list of questions you want to ask for the selected visualization. Keep the questions broad so you can get the most value out of your feedback. Then, document answers to your questions here._

Questions to ask (modify these for your own interviews): 

- Can you tell me what you think this is?

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

Results: 

_Don't identify or share personally identifiable information (PII) about the people you spoke to._


| Question | Interview 1 | Interview 2 |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |

Synthesis: 

_What patterns in the feedback emerge?  What did you learn from the feedback?  Based on this feedback, come up with what design changes you think might make the most sense in your final redesign._

## Step five: build the solution

_Include and describe your final solution here. It's also a good idea to summarize your thoughts on the process overall. When you're done with the assignment, this page should all the items mentioned in the assignment page on Canvas(a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.)._
