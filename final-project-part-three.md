## References
> All references are available on the main website. In particular, I want to highlight the role of TripAdvisor testimonials in shaping my understanding of the emotional impact of these memorials. Alongside these firsthand visitor experiences, I have extensively referenced scholarly materials to build a well-rounded dataset that informs this story.

## AI acknowledgements
> I used chatgpt to help with python coding for the googlecolab data viz table created. Other than that I used copilot for paraphrasing my CTA and grammarly for grammar check.
