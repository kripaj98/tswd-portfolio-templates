# Changes made since Part II
> Since Part II, I have refined the project by streamlining the narrative and being more mindful of time constraints. I realised I was being an overachiever, but the main point was getting lost in the process. Instead of viewing this as a finalized end product, I decided to approach it as a prototype, a starting point to explore how memorial spaces evoke emotion. The goal is to spark curiosity, encourage further research, and raise awareness about the emotional impact of architectural design. Keeping in mind of the inputs and feedback received I wanted to make sure that the audience is able to understand this project, an audience here who has little to no architecture background. 

Key changes include:<br/>
Refined Scope: Reduced the number of memorials mapped globally to five, while conducting a more in-depth case study of one to provide richer insights.<br/>
Stronger Focus on Key Insights: Emphasized the relationships between emotion and material, emotion and light, and other design elements to draw final insights based on 30 identified memorial, to create a clearer, more thought-provoking narrative.<br/>
Enhanced Emotional Mapping: Used clear color as a legend for emotional navigation, ensuring a logical and intuitive flow. Since this was the trickiest aspect, I relied on Plutchik’s Wheel of Emotions as a solid reference to ground the visual storytelling. Using the reference as much as possible, through words,gradient bars and across the data viz developed.<br/>


Overall, these refinements shift the project from being just an analysis with a final takeaway to an interactive and thought-provoking prototype, encouraging deeper reflection on how spaces shape emotions.

## The audience
This project is a prototype to inspire deeper research and mindful design, mapping emotions, not just spaces. Through emotional mapping, visitor testimonials, and scholarly research, I identified two key audiences: spatial designers and visitors.

For spatial designers, the project distills complex architectural concepts into an experience-driven approach, balancing technical insights with emotional impact. By focusing on materials, lighting, and spatial elements, it encourages prototyping and intentional design to create spaces that guide visitors through meaningful emotional journeys.

For visitors, the project shifts from data-heavy analysis to a more intuitive, sentiment-driven experience, using moving data visualizations and narrative storytelling to make emotional connections tangible. Instead of passively observing, they are prompted to engage with memorials intentionally through route of movement, recognizing how design choices influence their emotions.

To make the story accessible, I kept the visuals and narrative concise, avoiding overly technical explanations.. I also refined the focus by reducing the number of memorials for deeper analysis and integrating Plutchik’s Wheel of Emotions as a guide for clear emotional navigation.

## Final design decisions
What stood out to me during this process was the powerful connection between design elements and human emotion. I never initially thought about something like an emotion route of movement, but I realized it became one of the most interesting parts of the narrative. The way visitors move through space, guided by materials, light, and spatial design, profoundly shapes their emotional experience. This project also taught me the importance of keeping the narrative simple and accessible, balancing technical data with an engaging, experience-based approach made the story much more impactful. It reinforced how emotions can be mapped through design, connecting both the designer's intentions and the visitor's experience. It also made me think about how this could look if scaled up to different institutions and housing designs. Could a holistic prototype be generated?

## References

Alongside these firsthand visitor experiences, I have extensively referenced scholarly materials to build a well-rounded dataset that informs this story.

# Final thoughts
Overall, the process was a journey of discovery. At one point, I felt I got lost in the sheer volume of work and data, wanting to fill the story with numerous data visualizations. It’s a common mistake to think more is better, but what really helped was returning to the core principles of minimalism and simplicity for clarity. I started asking myself key questions: What is each data visualization trying to convey? Is it necessary, or can it be avoided? Is there a missing loop in the narrative? These reflections guided me in refining the final draft and ensuring each element added purpose to the story. Ultimately, it was about focusing on what truly mattered and maintaining a cohesive flow, while knowing your audience.
